### Words
Words within a language are also not completely arbitrary. Speakers of a language are even able to understand many new words which follow the familiar patterns of other words in the language.
For eg, consider the word 'Google', originating as the proper noun referring to the popular search engine, which many people are still comfortable using as a verb.

### Grammatical judgement
We also know when sentences are malformed
- "I have been dancing anymore" (negative)

The lack of a negative here makes the sentence seem incorrect, even though we lack an explicit reason to point at and say, 'this is why you cannot do this'.

### Contextual judgement
Many languages (notably excluding English) have honorific systems for their pronouns.
It would be a faux pas to say "tu kab record karegi?" to your teacher (and it may or may not get you in hot water).

### Disambiguation deictic terms
'deictic' terms are those which have no meaning out of context, and refer to something else.
- "Rohan ne apne bete ko thappad maara kyonki **voh** piiyaa hua tha"

The sentence here is ambiguous, who does 'voh' refer to? We might have had a clue to it, if we had referred to 'Rohan' as 'Sharmaji' perhaps we could've been a bit more sure that it was Rohan's son who was drunk, because we did not use "... veh piiye hue the".

### Infer from world knowledge
We often use "common sense" to disambiguate and infer the meaning of a sentence or phrase.
- "Mother sold the cow because **she** needed money."
- "Mother sold the cow because **she** had stopped giving milk."

We can guess as to who 'she' refers to from what we consider to be obvious, since cows do not usually make monetary transactions, we can safely assume that it was 'Mother' who needed the money.

## The study of language
The study of language has long been *diachronic*, dealing more with the traditional and literary use of language, the origin of words (etymology) etc.
We can also look at things *synchronically*, dealing more with the contemporary use of the language, and what shape it has moulded itself into in the present.
